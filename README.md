# YourDismissedTY
A tweak giving new life to Pls Dismiss Alert (it adds a cancel action to all UIAlerts that donâ€™t have one so you can circumvent forced updates or JB detection.)that was a cool tweak that became deprecated when UIAlerts were change to having to be called from an alert controller in iOS 10.  This tweak should work from iOS 9-17.
